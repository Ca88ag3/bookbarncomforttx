      <p><em><strong>Not Barnes and Noble, just a noble barn</strong></em>. With an incredible selection of used books across a wide variety 
        of genres, you're bound to find something you'll enjoy. Run by volunteers and friends of Comfort Public Library. 
        All sales are by donation and 100% of proceeds go directly to the library! We're open 10am-2pm every Saturday 
        (later if busy or during community events). Check it out, tell your friends, and come find some great books at 
        The Book Barn in Comfort TX.</p>
